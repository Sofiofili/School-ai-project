# School-ai-project
objective of the school project was to make a working bot to play awele, a african boardgame.

My bot is located in: src/awele/bot/competitor/BotBot.java
this is my work on the given objective and I used a minmax algorithm for the problem.
Everything other than the BotBot.java is made by my professor and I'm not taking any credit of his work.
You can easily identify what is made by him by looking at the comments, they should be in french.
